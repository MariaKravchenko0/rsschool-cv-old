## ABOUT ME

Hardworking and responsible, but without any background in web-development, I am passionate about learning new things and willing to overcome difficulties on the way.\
Since I have a four-year experience of teaching English to children and teens, my strong suit is such skills as flexibility, patience, communication and quick mind. However, I feel ready to change my field of activity and try a completely new sphere.\
My life goal is to continue my professional and self-development, that is why I hope to gain new exciting experience in IT industry.
